## Front-End Web Development with React

This course explores Javascript based front-end application development, and in particular the React library in which we used JavaScript ES6 for developing React application. I learnt the use of Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design. I learnt various aspects of React components. I also learnt about React router and its use in developing single-page applicatios and about designing controlled forms. I got introduced to the Flux architecture and Redux.I explored various aspects of Redux and use it to develop React-Redux powered applications. Then we used Fetch for client-server communication and use of REST API on the server side. We did a quick tour through React animation support.
